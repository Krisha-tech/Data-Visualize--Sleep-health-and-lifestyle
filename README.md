# Data-Visualize--Sleep-health-and-lifestyle

This repository contains analysis and visualizations related to the impact of occupation on sleep duration and quality, the presence of sleep disorders, and the correlation between physical activity, stress levels, and sleep quality.

## Overview

The dataset used in this analysis includes information on individuals such as their occupation, sleep duration, sleep quality, physical activity level, stress level, BMI category, blood pressure, heart rate, daily steps, and the presence of sleep disorders.

## Problems Addressed

1. **Analyzing the Impact of Occupation on Sleep Duration and Quality**
   - Analyze how different occupations affect sleep duration and quality.
   - Perform statistical tests to determine if there are significant differences between occupations.

2. **Presence of Sleep Disorders**
   - Examine the distribution and prevalence of sleep disorders across different occupations and other variables.
   - Use cross-tabulation and visualizations to understand the prevalence of sleep disorders.

3. **Correlation Between Physical Activity, Stress Levels, and Sleep Quality**
   - Investigate how physical activity and stress levels correlate with sleep quality.
   - Use correlation analysis and regression models to explore these relationships.
   - Visualize relationships using pair plots and bubble charts.
